The data and code used to analyse the data in this experiment - I didn't write a lab report for this, so there is none in the repository.

Part 4 does not generate the desired hysteresis curve. If by some miracle someone is looking at this and wants to figure it out, be my guest. Please let me know if you figure it out because I have no idea what to do.

Also, some of the codes take inputs generated from previous parts, so run them in order.
